<h3>Clustering</h3>
<p> Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. <br>
It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."
It does it by finding some similar patterns in the unlabelled dataset such as shape, size, color, behavior, etc., and divides them as per the presence and absence of those similar patterns.
</p>
<p>
It is an unsupervised learning method, hence no supervision is provided to the algorithm, and it deals with the unlabeled dataset.</p>

<p>The clustering technique can be widely used in various tasks. Some most common uses of this technique are:<br>

1. Market Segmentation<br>
2. Statistical data analysis<br>
3. Social network analysis<br>
4. Image segmentation<br>
5. Anomaly detection, etc.
